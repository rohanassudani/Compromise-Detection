Anomaly Detection in System Security 🛡️🔍
This project applies Anomaly Detection techniques to detect unusual patterns or potential compromises in system behavior. The primary objective is to enhance the security of systems by identifying deviations from normal operating conditions, which could indicate a security threat or breach.

🌟 Project Overview
The project revolves around the use of machine learning models to detect anomalies in system logs and metrics, which can signal potential compromises in the infrastructure. Anomaly detection is critical in cybersecurity, where timely detection of irregular patterns can prevent security incidents.
